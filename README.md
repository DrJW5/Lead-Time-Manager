# Lead-Time-Manager
The Lead Time Manager is a simulation-game I developed at the University of Lausanne with Prof. Suzanne de Treville to illustrate our research insights about the impact of lead time reduction on volatility exposure and cost of mismatch between supply and demand.

This is an EARLY version of the program. 

A more current version can be found at: https://forio.com/app/lausanne/new3

In this simulation-game, the player takes the role of a manager faced with a supply and demand problem. The shop sells two types of ski jackets: Fashion and Standard, with different cost, price and demand volatility characteristics. Each jacket has a variable demand each season, for which the mean and median are given.

The manager can choose to order offshore to a long lead time supplier, or to develop a local production. When ordering offshore, the order must be done before demand for the season is known. When producing locally, employees are hired and machines are bought, creating fixed costs, but production can be done on-demand.

Trial and errors make the tradeoff between lower unit cost and longer delay very palpable.
